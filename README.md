## Design
- Target

My mother has more adults students than children in her studio. 
She wants to keep getting more adult students,so I set the target as over 30 years old adult students who want to start taking ballet lessons.

- Wireframe

I paid attention most to wireframing and layouts so that users could easily check class schedules and class prices.

- Design

After wireframing, I carefully picked the colours and Font family of the design.
And I made it as a responsive design. 


## Development

### SASS & Gulp

I used SASS as a CSS processor and Gulp as a task runner. It helped me a lot to code stylesheet much faster and I easily could make reuseable variables and Mixins.

### ScrollReveal

ScrollReveal is one of the Javascript libraries.
It easily displays elements with animations upon scrolling to the height of elements. 

### ANIMSITION

ANIMSITION is also Javascript library. This library makes page transitions smoother with animations.
